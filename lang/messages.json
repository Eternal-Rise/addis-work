In a country where the largest newspaper is only 10,000 pieces printed and mobile Internet penetration is only 16% it's very difficult for job seekers to get notified of new jobs on time.<br/><br/><b>Addis Work will solve this problem by delivering vacancy announcements via text. You get notified in real time because of the seamless integration of our software with Ethio Telecom.</b>",
