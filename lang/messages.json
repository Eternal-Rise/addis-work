    "MESSAGE_INFO_LANDING_ABOUT": "Our vision is to create a system that will allow anyone with a mobile phone to receive new vacancies on their phone via SMS. <b>There are 17 million jobs seekers in Ethiopia having 200,000 new professional job seekers added to this number.</b> The current way of delivering these vacancies is via news papers and through Internet. In a country where the largest newspaper is only 10,000 pieces printed and mobile Internet penetration is only 16% it's very difficult for job seekers to get notified of new jobs on time.<br/><br/><b>Addis Work will solve this problem by delivering vacancy announcements via text. You get notified in real time because of the seamless integration of our software with Ethio Telecom.</b>",
